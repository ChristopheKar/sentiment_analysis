INSTRUCTIONS

All Jupyter notebooks can be run in a Google Colab environment or any other environment.
In any environment, the files dataset.zip and utils.py should be placed in the same directory as the Jupyter notebooks.

For use in Google Colab:
- Upload the Jupyter notebook to you Google Drive folder.
- Right-click on the notebook and open with Google Colab.
- In Colab, specify the runtime acceleration as 'GPU' or 'TPU' (in Runtime --> Change Runtime Type)
- On the left-hand side panel, go to the files tab and upload the dataset.zip and utils.py files.
- Run the cells as instructed in the notebook.
